## Q1. dbt Lineage and Execution

Given a dbt project with the following structure:

```
models/
├── staging/
│   ├── stg_green_tripdata.sql
│   └── stg_yellow_tripdata.sql
└── intermediate/
    └── int_trips_unioned.sql (depends on stg_green_tripdata & stg_yellow_tripdata)
```

If you run `dbt run --select int_trips_unioned`, what models will be built?

Answer: `int_trips_unioned` only


## Q2. dbt Tests

You've configured a generic test like this in your `schema.yml`:

```yaml
columns:
  - name: payment_type
    data_tests:
      - accepted_values:
          arguments:
            values: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
            quote: false
```

Your model `fct_trips` has been running successfully for months. A new value `6` now appears in the source data.

What happens when you run `dbt test --select fct_trips`?

Answer: `dbt will fail the test, returning a non-zero exit code`


## Q3. Counting Records in `fct_monthly_zone_revenue`

After running your dbt project, query the `fct_monthly_zone_revenue` model.

What is the count of records in the `fct_monthly_zone_revenue` model?

```bash
dbt show --inline "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM {{ ref('fct_monthly_zone_revenue') }}" --target prod
```

Answer: `12184`



## Q4. Best Performing Zone for Green Taxis (2020)

Using the `fct_monthly_zone_revenue` table, find the pickup zone with the **highest total revenue** (`revenue_monthly_total_amount`) for **Green** taxi trips in 2020.

Which zone had the highest revenue?

```bash
dbt show --inline "
SELECT
    pickup_zone,
    revenue_monthly_total_amount
FROM {{ ref('fct_monthly_zone_revenue') }}
WHERE
    service_type = 'Green' 
    AND year(revenue_month) = 2020 
ORDER BY revenue_monthly_total_amount DESC
" --target prod
```

Answer: `East Harlem North`



## Q5. Green Taxi Trip Counts (October 2019)

Using the `fct_monthly_zone_revenue` table, what is the **total number of trips** (`total_monthly_trips`) for Green taxis in October 2019?

```bash
dbt show --inline "
SELECT 
    SUM(total_monthly_trips)
FROM {{ ref('fct_monthly_zone_revenue') }} 
WHERE 
    service_type = 'Green' 
    AND year(revenue_month) = 2019 
    AND month(revenue_month) = 10
" --target prod
```

Answer: `384,624`


## Q6. Build a Staging Model for FHV Data

Create a staging model for the **For-Hire Vehicle (FHV)** trip data for 2019.

1. Load the [FHV trip data for 2019](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/tag/fhv) into your data warehouse
2. Create a staging model `stg_fhv_tripdata` with these requirements:
   - Filter out records where `dispatching_base_num IS NULL`
   - Rename fields to match your project's naming conventions (e.g., `PUlocationID` → `pickup_location_id`)

What is the count of records in `stg_fhv_tripdata`?

```bash
dbt show --inline "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM {{ ref('stg_fhv_tripdata') }}" --target prod
```

Answer: `43244693`
